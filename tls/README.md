# Klarity TLS setup


## Bcc Wallet

Starting with Bcc 1.3.0 version TLS certificates are autogenerated on each application start on the Bcc side and provided to Klarity via launcher `tlsPath` variable. Since launcher is not used in development mode, developers are expected to set `BCC_TLS_PATH` environment variable which points to their local Bcc TLS files directory: `{path-to-bcc-sl}/run/tls-files/`.

## Mantis Wallet

Mantis integration also provides correct TLS files through launcher variable in production mode while in development mode Klarity is using certificates from `klarity/tls/` directory.
